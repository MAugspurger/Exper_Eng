When we calibrate a load cell, for example, we used known reference standards for force as an input  (masses pulled down by gravity).  The load cell $transduces$ that input into an output: voltage.

What is our known input?  It is the quality of the reference standard that we know: the kinematic viscosity.  And what is this input transduced into?
